Pesonal webpage projects are created to tell something about their creators, but years ago I approached to leave it in a Now, when looking back, it was all wrong - I stubbed it with a framework and never found time to properly plan it. Ultimately, I found the project not engaging enough.

I am revisiting it in 2020 to start anew, start small, and turn it into a developer learning experience. I want to use this opportunity to tell my story, while learning about UX, hand-made SPAs and whatever else on my way there.

As of now, I plan on having it as simple as I can, while providing a smooth (and hopefull interesting) user experience. I want to limit webpack usage for minification/obfuscation.
